Overview

This project leverages the Python Image Library (PIL) to develop a script that accurately identifies digital images within a specified directory. It prompts users for a directory path, verifies its existence, iterates through each file in the directory, examines them using PIL, and generates a report using PrettyTable.
Features

    Directory Path Input: Prompt the user to input a directory path for image search.
    Path Verification: Verify that the provided path exists and is a directory.
    Image Examination: Utilize PIL to examine each file in the specified directory.
    PrettyTable Report: Generate a PrettyTable report summarizing the search results.

Overview

This Python script is designed to extract metadata from digital images using the Python Image Library (PIL). It automates the process of identifying and extracting valuable metadata from images, such as EXIF data, to facilitate further analysis or processing.
Features

    Metadata Extraction: Automatically extract metadata from digital images.
    PIL Integration: Utilizes PIL (Pillow) for comprehensive image analysis.
    User-Friendly: Prompts user for the directory path to search for images.
    Report Generation: Summarizes extracted metadata in an easily readable format.
